Worked solution to HowToGraphQL's [Node tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/0-introduction/).

Back-end:
- graphql-yoga: Fully-featured GraphQL server with focus on easy setup, performance & great developer experience. Built on top of Express, apollo-server, graphql-js and more.
- Prisma: GraphQL abstraction layer that turns your database into a GraphQL API which provides powerful, realtime CRUD operations for your data model.
- Node.js: Runtime environment for building servers with JavaScript. GraphQL itself is programming language agnostic, so check out the other tutorials in this section if you prefer to use another language.
- GraphQL Playground: Extremely useful tool for quickly testing GraphQL APIs. Thereâ€™s no need to build a whole frontend app just to test use cases, but it can also be a pain to build and send GraphQL requests manually using Postman or other similar tools.
